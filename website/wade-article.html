          The next time you go strawberry picking, imagine how much harder it would be if
          the fruit were the same colour as the leaves. If you are a man, there is a 10%
          chance that they are! So is this a problem you need to worry about?

          Roughly 1 in 10 men are fully or partly colour blind. This means that one of the
          three types of colour detectors in their eyes is either faulty or missing
          altogether. The condition is hereditary and sex-linked: fathers will pass the gene to
          their daughters (but not their sons) and mothers can pass it to all their
          children. However, because women can be unaffected carriers, men are at least 20 times
          more likely than women to develop colour blindness.
        </p>

        <p>
          Colour blindness is not a particularly serious condition. Although one type of
          colour detector (or cone cell) is missing, the gaps are filled seamlessly by
          cones of the other two sorts. The more important aspects of vision are rarely
          affected. People who are colour blind are, in general, no more likely to suffer from
          short- or long-sightedness or to develop eye diseases such as glaucoma or
          cataracts later in life.
        </p>

        <p>
          The effects of colour blindness are so mild that many boys only realise that
          they have it at a relatively late age. Since they were born colour blind, the world
          has always looked perfectly normal to them. It is only when they have a sight
          test at school, or get into an argument with a friend about whether something is
          red or green, that they find their view of the world does not always match that
          of other people.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is important to remember that people with colour blindness generally can see
          most colours; they just have trouble distinguishing between some shades of red
          and green. Apart from making terrible strawberry pickers, people who are colour
          blind are excluded from certain jobs for safety reasons. For example, they cannot
          be airline pilots, policemen or ship captains. Their everyday lives are also
          fraught with occasional minor hazards: how to match socks, how to decide whether
          the power indicator on the stereo is red or green, how to find red golf tees in
          the grass and how to choose an appropriate colour scheme for decorating the
          house.
        </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 32px; margin-bottom: 16px;">Clever ways to compensate for colour blindness</h2>

        <p>
          If you are colour blind, there are some strategies that can help. Getting a
          friend or partner to advise on matching socks and ties will stop you committing the
          more serious fashion crimes, while asking a shop assistant's advice when buying
          clothes, paint, carpets and wallpaper is just common sense. Most colour-blind
          people learn at an early age to use clues to help them guess what colour something
          might be. Red and green traffic lights might look similar but as long as you
          remember that red is always at the top, you can't go far wrong! Sometimes, red and
          green things that look alike under fluorescent light will look different in the
          daylight. Try taking your ties nearer to the window in a shop before you decide
          which one to buy.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the positive side, there is some evidence that colour-blind people are much
          better than average at certain jobs. They are very good at finding green things
          hidden against green backgrounds - for example grass or leaves. They tend to find
          things by shape and get less confused by camouflage. Because of this,
          colour-blind entomologists still catch lots of bugs and in wartime, armies prize their
          colour-blind snipers and spotters. So, if you are colour blind and have trouble
          picking strawberries, why not try your hand at green beans or peas instead? You
          might be surprised at how well you do!
